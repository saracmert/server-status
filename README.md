***WARNING***:This is experimental and in development. All files in this repo is licensed under GNU AGPLv3.

*Do you want to monitor your server without using SSH?*

*Don't you know how to use difficult commands? (looks like a spell!)*

> **OK! Leave all to this plugin!**

"Server Status" adds widget like 'uptime' command in Dashboard and Network Admin Dashboard.

## Notice
* **Currently, only RHEL/CentOS is tested.** And OS X is tesing now! (The number of tested OS will increase shortly.)
* **PECL Zend OPcache users**, *please add server-status.php* to black list! Otherwise, there must be segmentation fault.
	This troublesome process isn't required on PHP5.5!
* **PHP 5.2 users**, your version of PHP is no longer supported.([Detail](http://www.php.net/eol.php)) If you're using such older version, this plugin nags at it!
